this is my attempt at trying to get yuuki to update the game

- step 1: load up vision
- step 2: use all the codes (found in the discord or here https://www.pockettactics.com/vision/codes as of jan 9 2025)
- step 3: get the dummy trait its a common so its gonna be easy
- step 4: load into a match (hardest step)
- step 5: execute script
